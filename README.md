## Project Description

I will be recreating the Petfinder website. I like the idea of doing an in depth search aspect to search for certain attributes of animals to adopt. 

## API

https://www.petfinder.com/developers/v2/docs/


```
"animals": [
        {
            "id": 120,
            "organization_id": "NJ333",
            "url": "https://www.petfinder.com/dog/spot-120/nj/jersey-city/nj333-petfinder-test-account/?referrer_id=d7e3700b-2e07-11e9-b3f3-0800275f82b1",
            "type": "Dog",
            "species": "Dog",
            "breeds": {
                "primary": "Akita",
                "secondary": null,
                "mixed": false,
                "unknown": false
            },
            "colors": {
                "primary": null,
                "secondary": null,
                "tertiary": null

```

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Also, define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP EXAMPLE
- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to interact with the page

#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

- Create a map to click on regions where person went missing
- Resources for people to help out

## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router| 
| Layout | This will present the information in a way that is pleasing to the eye |
| Map | Map of the world thats interactive |
| Header | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Carousel | Shows different aspects of site |
| Footer | This will render the header include the nav | 


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs|
| CSS and HTML | H | 5 hrs | 2 hrs
|React animations | L | 2 hrs |
| In depth search aspect | H | 5 hrs |
| Creating map of the U.S. in React | L | 5 hrs | 
|Carousel| L| 2.5 hrs |
| Find photos and resources | H | 1.5 hrs | 1 hr |
| Research | H | 1.5 hrs | 
| Forms | H | 2 hrs |
| Total | H | 31.5 hrs |

## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project such as Axios, ReactStrap, D3, etc. 

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description.  Code snippet should not be greater than 10 lines of code. 

```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```
