# Project-2

# Project Overview

## Project Links

- [add your github repo link]()
- [add your deployment link]()

## Project Description

I will be creating a site that shows you random drink recipes where you can search for what type of alcohol you would like in your drink so that you can practice your bartending skills while the world is quarantined. 

## API

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Also, define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP EXAMPLE
- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to interact with the page

#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

- Create multiple searches so people can search by other ingredients

## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router| 
| Layout | This will present the information in a way that is pleasing to the eye |
| Map | Map of the world thats interactive |
| Header | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Carousel | Shows different aspects of site |
| Footer | This will render the header include the nav | 


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Deploying | 1 hr | 30 mins | 1 hr |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 9 hrs | 10 hrs |
| CSS and HTML | H | 5 hrs | 5 hrs | 10 hrs |
| In depth search aspect | H | 5 hrs | 2 hrs| 3 hrs |
|Carousel| L| 2.5 hrs | 1 hr | 1.5 hr |
| Find photos and resources | H | 1.5 hrs | 1 hr |
| Research | H | 1.5 hrs | 2 hrs | 3 hrs |
| Forms | H | 2 hrs | 2 hrs | 2 hrs |
|Redoing WS | 1 hr | 1 hr | 1 hr |
| Total | H | 31.5 hrs | 32.5 hrs |

## Additional Notes
 - After trying to get the API to work and reaching out to multiple resources, Doug discovered that the petfinder api wouldnt work because it reset every 20 minutes. I had to start my project over from scratch today. 
 - I wanted a featured drink page but the api only allowed for one random to show up unless you paid for their Patreon. 

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description.  Code snippet should not be greater than 10 lines of code. 

```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```
